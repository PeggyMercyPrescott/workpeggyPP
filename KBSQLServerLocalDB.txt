Enter SqlLocalDB.exe
SqlLocalDB.exe is a tool provided by Microsoft that can be used to manage the instances of LocalDB on your box. This tool is usually at C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\{ver}\Tools\Binn location where {ver} references to the version of SQL Server you are using.

So navigate to the location above and fire this command

SqlLocalDB -info
You will notice an output like this

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn>SqlLocalDB.exe i
MSSQLLocalDB
ProjectsV12
v11.0
The above are the instances of LocalDB that I have running on my machine. Next I select one instance and again fire the info command

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn>SqlLocalDB.exe i ProjectsV12
Name: ProjectsV12
Version: 12.0.2000.8
Shared name:
Owner: FIREBALL\Nik Gupta
Auto-create: No
State: Stopped
Last start time: 09-Dec-15 2:38:45 PM
Instance pipe name:
As you can notice on my machine named FIREBALL (I told you I need help) this particular instance is stopped. So let us start it.

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn>SqlLocalDB.exe start ProjectsV12
LocalDB instance "ProjectsV12" started.
Now with the instance started if I run the info command again I get a value for the “Instance pipe name” property (highlighted below)

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn>SqlLocalDB.exe i ProjectsV12
Name: ProjectsV12
Version: 12.0.2000.8
Shared name:
Owner: FIREBALL\Nik Gupta
Auto-create: No
State: Running
Last start time: 10-Dec-15 9:47:12 AM
Instance pipe name: np:\\.\pipe\LOCALDB#E81A1F33\tsql\query

Simply copy this value and paste it in the SQL Server Management Studio’s “Server Name” property

Copy np:\\.\pipe\LOCALDB#E81A1F33\tsql\query and put it to Server Name on connection
